# Programming Quiz Application

An AI-powered application for generating and evaluating programming quizzes across multiple languages, with webcam-based proctoring.

## Features

- **Multi-language Support**: Generate quizzes for Python, C++, Java, and C
- **AI-Powered Question Generation**: Uses Google Gemini to create unique programming challenges
- **Automated Code Evaluation**: AI evaluation of submitted code with detailed feedback
- **Webcam Proctoring**: YOLOv5-based monitoring for suspicious activities during quizzes
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Clean UI for question selection, code editing, and result display

## Technical Architecture

- **Backend**: Flask web server
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for question generation and code evaluation
- **Computer Vision**: YOLOv5 for webcam monitoring
- **Frontend**: HTML, Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Google Gemini API key
- Required Python packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd programming-quiz-app
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. API Key Configuration

Set up your Google Gemini API key:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### 3. Running the Application

Start the Flask application:

```bash
python main.py
```

Or use gunicorn for production deployment:

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
```

The application will start and be accessible at:
- `http://localhost:5000` - Main index
- `http://localhost:5000/quiz/python` - Python quiz
- `http://localhost:5000/quiz/cpp` - C++ quiz
- `http://localhost:5000/quiz/c` - C quiz
- `http://localhost:5000/quiz/java` - Java quiz

## Usage Guide

### Accessing Language-Specific Quiz Pages

1. **Starting the Application**:
   - Run the application:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
   - Or for production environments:
     ```bash
     gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app
     ```

2. **Accessing Language-Specific Quizzes**:
   - Navigate to one of these URLs based on your preferred language:
     - Python: `http://localhost:5000/quiz/python`
     - C++: `http://localhost:5000/quiz/cpp` 
     - C: `http://localhost:5000/quiz/c`
     - Java: `http://localhost:5000/quiz/java`

3. **Taking a Quiz**:
   - Select a question from the list
   - Write your solution in the code editor
   - Submit your code for AI evaluation
   - Review your scores and feedback

### Example: Taking a C++ Quiz

1. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. Navigate to the C++ quiz page:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/quiz/cpp
   ```
   
3. You'll see C++-specific programming questions generated by Google Gemini

4. Select a question and write your C++ solution in the editor

5. Submit your code for evaluation

6. The AI will analyze your solution based on C++ standards and requirements, providing detailed feedback

## Webcam Proctoring

The application includes a webcam-based proctoring system that:

- Periodically captures webcam images during quiz sessions
- Uses YOLOv5 to detect suspicious behaviors (multiple people, phone usage, etc.)
- Flags potential cheating attempts

## Customization

### Adding New Programming Languages

Edit the application to support additional languages:

1. Add a new route in `main.py` following the existing pattern (`/quiz/<language>`)
2. Update the language mapping in the `generate_questions_for_technology` function
3. Add appropriate starter code templates for the new language
4. Ensure the AI evaluation prompt correctly specifies language-specific criteria

## Troubleshooting

- **API Key Issues**: Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly set in the environment variables
- **Question Generation Errors**: Check logs for specific error details and adjust prompts if needed
- **YOLOv5 Detection Issues**: Ensure proper lighting for accurate webcam detection
